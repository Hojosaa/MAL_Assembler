# Assembler Project


### Overview:
In this project I am tasked to write an assembler for a made up language called "MAL"; WHICH IS BASED OFF HACK ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE, The goal  is to be able to convert from the MAL
language to binary.

## What is an Assembler??

"An assembler program creates object code by translating combinations of mnemonics and syntax for operations and addressing modes into their numerical equivalents." (Wikipedia)

## What is MAL??

MAL is a language created for the purpose of this project by my university professor; David Barnes, to test our understanding from our lectures/further reading to implement an assembler using an object-oriented approach.

## Required Reading

For this specific module we worked very closely with the "From NAND to Tetris" textbook, where its goal is to teach how computer systems work, starting from the fundamental logic gates and how it makes up various components (such as ALU and RAM) until the point where we can create a game of tetris
